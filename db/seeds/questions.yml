  - :content: What does DSL stand for and why does it come up when describing Ruby?
    :answer: A Domain Specific Language is an API that allows you to solve a problem
      or represent data more naturally than you could otherwise. The flexible nature
      of Ruby's syntax and the ability to alias and alter existing methods and classes
      makes it conducive to creating DSL's.
    :category_name: Language Characteristics and Core Objects
  - :content: What is duck typing and how does it apply to Ruby?
    :answer: That an object may be acted upon even if it isn't the expected type as
      long as it looks and behaves like the expected object. This is a characteristic
      of Ruby because the lack of type checking of parameters makes this an effective
      programming technique.
    :category_name: Language Characteristics and Core Objects
  - :content: Is Ruby a statically typed or a dynamically typed language?
    :answer: Dynamically typed since type checking is done at runtime.
    :category_name: Language Characteristics and Core Objects
  - :content: Is Ruby a strongly typed or a weakly typed language?
    :answer: Strongly typed since an object's type is checked before an operation is
      performed on it.
    :category_name: Language Characteristics and Core Objects
  - :content: What does it mean to coerce an object? Why would you do it?
    :answer: To coerce the object into an expected type. You might do this in order
      to try and force an unknown object type into the expected type or format required
      by the operation.
    :category_name: Language Characteristics and Core Objects
  - :content: What is the difference between a statement and an expression in Ruby?

    :category_name: Operators
  - :content: Why are symbols typically used as hash keys instead of strings?
    :answer: Strings are mutable while symbols are immutable. Though Ruby internally
      makes an immutable copy of a string when used as a hash key, comparing two symbols
      is faster than comparing two `String` objects. This is also a convention.

    :answer: "`<=>`"
    :category_name: Operators
  - :content: What is the difference between `#==` and `#equal?`?
    :answer: "`#==` performs the generic comparison and is implemented differently across
      classes while `#equal?` is defined on `BasicObject` and compares object identity.
      Therefore, `#equal?` should not be overridden in subclasses."
    :category_name: Operators
  - :content: What is the difference between `#==` and `#===`?
    :answer: "`#==` performs the generic comparison while `#===` performs case equality
      comparison and is useful for providing meaningful semantics in case statements."
    :category_name: Operators
  - :content: What is the difference between `#==` and `#eql?`?
    :answer: "`#eql?` is sometimes an alternate equality. `Hash` uses `#eql?` to test
      for hash key equality. `Numeric` types perform type conversion across `#==` but
      not across `#eql?`, thus `#eql?` performs a stricter comparison than `#==` in
      that case."

    :category_name: Control Structures
  - :content: What is the difference between `throw/catch` and `raise/rescue`?
    :answer: "`throw` and `catch` accept matching symbols as arguments and should be
      considered a control-flow structure where `raise` and `rescue` is used to raise
      and handle exceptions. `throw` and `catch` are not commonly used while exception
      handling with `raise` and `rescue` is used often - a `rescue` clause is a fundamental
      part of the Ruby language."

    :category_name: Methods
  - :content: When might you use the `do`/`end` syntax versus using the curly bracket
      syntax for a block?
    :answer: The `do`/`end` syntax for a block is commonly used for multi-line statements.
      An alternate convention is to use curly bracket syntax for blocks that return
      a value while using `do`/`end` syntax for blocks that change the state of the
      system somehow and do not return a value.
    :category_name: Blocks and Iterators
  - :content: What is an iterator?

    :answer: "`#reduce`"
    :category_name: Blocks and Iterators
  - :content: Why might you use `#each` instead of `for/in`?
    :answer: It's the "Ruby way" - it is an example of how Ruby defines methods that
      mimic natural language concepts. Iterator methods such as `#each` read more naturally.
      `#each` is a block so it defines a new variable scope. `for/in` depends on the
      existence of `#each` which implies that `#each` is a more fundamental part of
      the language.
    :category_name: Blocks and Iterators
  - :content: What happens if a block in Ruby 1.9+ is passed two arguments but only
      accepts one argument?
    :answer: Nothing. Only the first argument will be passed to the block.

    :category_name: Procs and Lambdas
  - :content: What is true about a method argument that is prefixed with `&`?
    :answer: It will refer to the calling block as a named Proc object. It must be the
      last argument in the parameter list.
    :category_name: Procs and Lambdas
  - :content: What is the main difference between procs and lambdas?
    :answer: Calling a lambda is more akin to invoking a method where a return statement
      in a lambda will return from the lambda itself, instead of returning from the
      lexically enclosing method, as procs do. Adding to this notion, lambdas must be
      invoked with the exact number of arguments as is required by method invocation,
      whereas procs are more flexible in receiving arguments.

  - :content: What is the difference between an instance variable and a class variable?
    :answer: A class variable is always evaluated in reference to the class object created
      by the enclosing class definition while an instance variables is always evaluated
      in reference to `self`. Instance variables cannot be used outside of instance
      methods.
    :category_name: Classes
  - :content: Why must a class name begin with a capital letter?

  - :content: What is an eigenclass?
    :answer: An anonymous class associated with an object. An object's singleton methods
      are instance methods of its associated eigenclass.
    :category_name: Classes
  - :content: What is the relationship between singleton methods and class methods?
    :answer: Class methods are singleton methods of the eigenclass associated with the
      class object.

  - :content: What is `Class::new`?
    :answer: A class method of the `Class` object that creates new classes.
    :category_name: Classes
  - :content: If `Class` `B` is nested within `Class` `A`, and there exists a class
      method on `A`, does `Class` `B` have access to this instance method on `Class`
      `A`?
    :answer: No. Nesting one class within another does not give the inner class any
      special access to the methods or variables of the outer class.
    :category_name: Classes
  - :content: Are eigenclasses inherited?
    :answer: The eigenclasses of an object are inherited from the eigenclasses of the
      superclass of the class object. An eigenclass of an object instance stands alone
      and does not inherit from any other classes.

    :category_name: Classes
  - :content: What does it mean that `#dup` and `#clone` perform shallow copies?
    :answer: The instance variables of the copy are copied by reference rather than
      by value.
    :category_name: Classes
  - :content: What is the difference between `#dup` and `#clone`?
    :answer: "`#clone` copies the frozen state of an object and any singleton methods
      of an object while `#dup` does neither."
    :category_name: Classes
  - :content: Why might you not need to pass any arguments to the `#initialize` method
      of a singleton class?
    :answer: Since there is only one instance of the class, there will only be one variation
      of the instance so any values it contains may be set explicitly from within the
      class definition (such as in the `#initialize` method itself).

  - :content: What is the superclass of `Class`?
    :answer: "`Module`"
    :category_name: Modules
  - :content: Why must module names begin with a capital letter?
    :answer: Because the module keyword creates a new constant that refers to the module
      and constants must begin with a capital letter.
    :category_name: Modules
  - :content: How might you check if a module has been included by an object?
    :answer: Using `#is_a?` such as with `my_obj.is_a? MyModule`.
    :category_name: Modules
  - :content: Concerning those methods that are namespaced by a module, why might you
      explicitly invoke those methods on `self` rather than on the name of the module?
    :answer: To DRY up the code. If the name of the module were to change then you would
      not have to change all the references to that module name. The object referenced
      by `self` would not change.
    :category_name: Modules
  - :content: Inferring from the behavior of `Module#include`, is this method a public
      or private instance method of `Module`?

  - :content: If `#super` is invoked without any arguments, which if any arguments get
      passed to the superclass method?
    :answer: All the arguments that were passed to the subclass method will be passed
      to the superclass method.
    :category_name: Inheritance
  - :content: Are instance methods inherited?
    :answer: No, since they are not defined by a class and thus are unrelated to the

    :answer: Yes.
    :category_name: Inheritance
  - :content: Are constants inherited?
    :answer: Yes.
    :category_name: Inheritance
  - :content: Are class variables inherited?
    :answer: No. The behavior is different than inheritance. Any alteration of a class
      variable by a subclass affects that class variable in the superclass and all other
      subclasses of the superclass.
    :category_name: Inheritance
  - :content: Why might you not want to use class variables?
    :answer: Their values can be changed at any point in the inheritance chain which
      could cause unexpected behavior in parent classes or subclasses which use those
      class variables.
    :category_name: Inheritance

      strings to fixed internal values.
    :category_name: 'Data Types: Symbol'
  - :content: Why are symbols typically used as hash keys instead of strings?
    :answer: Strings are mutable while symbols are immutable. Though Ruby internally
      makes an immutable copy of a string when used as a hash key, comparing two symbols
      is faster than comparing two `String` objects. This is also a convention.

  - :content: Why might you use `#each` instead of `for/in`?
    :answer: It's the "Ruby way" - it is an example of how Ruby defines methods that
      mimic natural language concepts. Iterator methods such as `#each` read more naturally.
      `#each` is a block so it defines a new variable scope. `for/in` depends on the
      existence of `#each` which implies that `#each` is a more fundamental part of
      the language.

  - :content: What is the main difference between procs and lambdas?
    :answer: Calling a lambda is more akin to invoking a method where a return statement
      in a lambda will return from the lambda itself, instead of returning from the
      lexically enclosing method, as procs do. Adding to this notion, lambdas must be
      invoked with the exact number of arguments as is required by method invocation,

    :answer: No. Nesting one class within another does not give the inner class any
      special access to the methods or variables of the outer class.

  - :content: Are instance methods inherited?
    :answer: No, since they are not defined by a class and thus are unrelated to the
      inheritance mechanism.
    :category_name: Inheritance
  - :content: Are eigenclasses inherited?
    :answer: The eigenclasses of an object are inherited from the eigenclasses of the
      superclass of the class object. An eigenclass of an object instance stands alone
      and does not inherit from any other classes.

  - :content: What happens to any return value of `#initialize`?
    :answer: It is ignored.
    :category_name: Classes
  - :content: What is a factory method?
    :answer: An initialization method that creates specialized instances of a class.
    :category_name: Classes
  - :content: What is the method to run initialization code on copied instances of an
      object?
    :answer: "`#initialize_copy`"
    :category_name: Classes
  - :content: What object is passed to `#initialize_copy`?
    :answer: The original object that is being copied.
    :category_name: Classes
  - :content: Does `#initialize_copy` override `#initialize`?
    :answer: No.
    :category_name: Classes
  - :content: What does it mean that `#dup` and `#clone` perform shallow copies?
    :answer: The instance variables of the copy are copied by reference rather than
      by value.
    :category_name: Classes
  - :content: What is the difference between `#dup` and `#clone`?
    :answer: "`#clone` copies the frozen state of an object and any singleton methods
      of an object while `#dup` does neither."
    :category_name: Classes
  - :content: Why might you not need to pass any arguments to the `#initialize` method
      of a singleton class?
    :answer: Since there is only one instance of the class, there will only be one variation
      of the instance so any values it contains may be set explicitly from within the
      class definition (such as in the `#initialize` method itself).

  - :content: What are two functions of modules?
    :answer: As mixins or as namespaces.
    :category_name: Modules
  - :content: Can a module be subclassed?
    :answer: No.
    :category_name: Modules
  - :content: What happens when a class includes a module?
    :answer: The instance methods of the module become instance methods of the class.
    :category_name: Modules
  - :content: What happens when an object extends a module?
    :answer: The instance methods of the module become singleton methods on the object.
    :category_name: Modules
  - :content: What is the superclass of `Class`?
    :answer: "`Module`"
    :category_name: Modules
  - :content: Why must module names begin with a capital letter?
    :answer: Because the module keyword creates a new constant that refers to the module
      and constants must begin with a capital letter.
    :category_name: Modules
  - :content: How might you check if a module has been included by an object?
    :answer: Using `#is_a?` such as with `my_obj.is_a? MyModule`.
    :category_name: Modules
  - :content: Concerning those methods that are namespaced by a module, why might you
      explicitly invoke those methods on `self` rather than on the name of the module?
    :answer: To DRY up the code. If the name of the module were to change then you would
      not have to change all the references to that module name. The object referenced
      by `self` would not change.
    :category_name: Modules
  - :content: Inferring from the behavior of `Module#include`, is this method a public
      or private instance method of `Module`?
    :answer: Private, because it can't be used outside of a `Module` or `Class` definition.
    :category_name: Modules
  - :content: What does `#module_function` do?
    :answer: Makes class copies of the specified methods and makes instance methods
      private.
    :category_name: Modules
  - :content: What is a `Struct` in Ruby?
    :answer: A core Ruby class that generates other classes containing accessor methods
      for the specified fields.
    :category_name: Structs
  - :content: Can you add methods to a `Struct`?
    :answer: Yes.
    :category_name: Structs
  - :content: What's the difference between `#is_a?` and `#instance_of?`?
    :answer: "`#instance_of?` ignores inheritance and any mixed-in modules."
    :category_name: Inheritance
  - :content: If `#super` is invoked without any arguments, which if any arguments get
      passed to the superclass method?
    :answer: All the arguments that were passed to the subclass method will be passed
      to the superclass method.
    :category_name: Inheritance
  - :content: Are class variables inherited?
    :answer: No. The behavior is different than inheritance. Any alteration of a class
      variable by a subclass affects that class variable in the superclass and all other
      subclasses of the superclass.
    :category_name: Inheritance
  - :content: Why might you not want to use class variables?
    :answer: Their values can be changed at any point in the inheritance chain which
      could cause unexpected behavior in parent classes or subclasses which use those
      class variables.
    :category_name: Inheritance
  - :content: What should you look out for when subclassing a class that is unknown
      to you?
    :answer: Overriding private methods or overwriting class variables.
    :category_name: Inheritance
  - :content: How might you prevent a method on a superclass from being inherited by
      a subclass?
    :answer: Override the method on the subclass or `undef` the method in the subclass.

  - :content: Name one method in Ruby core that might be considered "metaprogramming."
    :answer: "`#attr_reader`, `#attr_accessor`, `#define_method`, `#method_missing`,
      `#const_missing`, `#eval`, `#class_eval`, `#instance_eval`..."
    :category_name: Metaprogramming
  - :content: Is `#attr_reader` an example of metaprogramming?
    :answer: Yes, since it creates getter methods at the time of the enclosing class
      definition.
    :category_name: Metaprogramming
  - :content: How might you access an instance variable of a receiver object from outside
      the scope of the receiver object?

    :answer: "`eigenclass = class << self; self; end`"
    :category_name: Metaprogramming
  - :content: How might you change method visibility from outside a class definition?
    :answer: Using `#class_eval`
    :category_name: Metaprogramming
  - :content: Why is `#eval` useful for testing code?
    :answer: Because it doesn't alter the local scope.
    :category_name: Metaprogramming
  - :content: What is the difference between `#instance_eval` and `#instance_exec`?
    :answer: "`#instance_exec` can only accept a block, and not a string, and it can
      accept arguments and pass them to the block, allowing the block to be evaluated
      in the context of the receiver object with parameters whose values come from the
      block."

    :answer: A global array of strings of the directories to be searched when loading
      files with the load and require methods. `$LOAD_PATH` is equivalent to `$:`.
    :category_name: 'Loading Modules, Files, and Gems: Loading'
  - :content: What is the difference between `#require` and `#load`?
    :answer: "`#require` can load binary extensions. `#require` does not require a filename
      extension. `#require` prevents multiple loads of the same file path. `#load` loads
      the specified file at the current `$SAFE` level while `#require` loads the specified
      file with a `$SAFE` level of 0."
